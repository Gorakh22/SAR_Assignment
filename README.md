This repository implements a Python 3.11+ pipeline for zooming into the Busan harbor region in SAR SLC imagery and demonstrating the effect of frequency-domain filtering using a Hann window. The code reads NITF-format SAR data, applies the selected window function, and generates comparative visualizations of the original and filtered images, including zoomed-in views.
